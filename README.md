# Generate Source Code Change Pattern from Review History

This rules can be used on [devreplay](https://www.npmjs.com/package/devreplay)
And you can use your rule by the [vscode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Ikuyadeu.devreplay)

## How to Use

### 0. Cloning this repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Ikuyadeu/review_pattern_gen.git
cd review_pattern_gen
pip3 install antlr4-python3-runtime unidiff gitpython
git clone https://github.com/Ikuyadeu/CodeTokenizer.git
```

### 1. Preparing config file

Making empty `config` file

```sh
touch config
```

and edit `config` file like berrow

* If you try first time, please check bottom example for the `Option` setting
* GitHub token can be generated from https://github.com/settings/tokens)

(If your target `Python` repository name is `tensorflow/models`)
```properties
[GitHub]
id = YourGitHubId
password = YourGitHubPassword
token = YourGitHubToken
[Target]
owner = Your Target GitHub Repository Owner (e.g. tensorflow)
repo = Your Target GitHub Repository (e.g. models)
lang = Your Target Language (e.g. Python, Ruby, Java, JavaScript, CPP)
[Option]
rule_size = Number of rules that you want (e.g. 100)
learn_from_pulls = If no, this tool will learn from master branch (e.g. yes or no)
abstract_master_change = If yes, this tool will abstract master changed identifier, string, number like `${1:NAME}` (e.g. yes or no)
validate_by_pulls = Check collected changes by pull changes or master changes. If `learn_from_pulls` is `no`, you can not choose yes (e.g. yes or no)

combined_owner = (**option if you want to use other project rules) Your Combination GitHub Repository Owner (e.g. tensorflow)
combined_repo = (**option if you want to use other projects' rules) Your Combination GitHub Repository (e.g. models)
```

`[Option]` is neccesaly. Plase see Use Case section and set variables.

### 2. Collecting training data set

If you set `learn_from_pulls` to `yes`, please run `collect_pulls.py` before run `test_rules.py`
```sh
python3 collect_pulls.py
```

Run `collect_changes.py` is necessary.

```sh
python3 collect_changes.py
```

After run these script, some files output to `data` dirs.The details are as follows.

Output:
* Pull List (`data/pulls/{owner}_{repo}.csv`)
* Master Change List (`data/changes/{owner}_{repo}_{lang}_master.json`)

If `Option/learn_from_pulls` is `yes`
* Pull Change List (`data/changes/{owner}_{repo}_{lang}_pulls.json`)


### 3. Extracting reusable changes

If you want to get more information about these output, please do this section.
```sh
python3 test_rules.py
```
You can get frequency,accuracy,failed_number(pull_requests),successed_number(pull_requests) informations.

Output:
* Pattern (`data/changes/{owner}_{repo}_{lang}_(pulls|master)_validated.json`)

### Sample

This repository put a part of `tensorflow/model` and `twbs/bootstrap-sass` rules on `data/changes` directory.
Also, these data is shorter than correct data set.

### Use Case, and How should you set config `Option`?

#### Case 1: If you want to get rules from small repository that does not have any pull request.

```properties
[Option]
rule_size = 1000
learn_from_pulls = no
abstract_master_change = yes
validate_by_pulls = no
```

#### Case 2: If you want to get rules from large repository that has more than 100 pull request.

```properties
[Option]
rule_size = 1000
learn_from_pulls = yes
abstract_master_change = no
validate_by_pulls = yes or no
```

#### Case 3: If you want to use rules from other repositories' for your repository.

1. Get Rules by

```properties
[Target]
owner = Other Project Repository Owner (e.g. tensorflow)
repo = Other Project Repository (e.g. models)
lang = Your Target Language
[Option]
rule_size = 1000
learn_from_pulls = no
abstract_master_change = yes
validate_by_pulls = no
```

2. Check Rules by 

```properties
[Target]
owner = Your Project Repository Owner
repo = Your Project Repository
lang = Your Target Language
[Option]
rule_size = 1000
learn_from_pulls = yes
abstract_master_change = no
validate_by_pulls = yes or no

combined_owner = Other Project Repository Owner
combined_repo = Other Project Repository
```
